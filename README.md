## Tools/Setup:

### Tools to install
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
We will be using IntelliJ as our IDE. This will allow us to write and run code, in addition to extra features like connecting to Git, dependency management, and shortcuts.

- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
This is only necessary for Windows users. This provides us a Terminal that has git installed, which allows us to use git commands. Also, this terminal is similar to the UNIX shells found on Mac and Linux.

- [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
There are many versions of free Java available, so take your pick. Most of the code we will be writing is not dependant on the Java version, but I'd probably choose either Java 8 or 11.

### Git
While not necessary in learning how to program, Git is essential in becoming a good programmer. Git is the standard for [version control](#glossary)

## Glossary
Term | Definition | Example | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
version control| system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later | If you write bad code and want to revert back to a old working version, version control allows you to do that |
